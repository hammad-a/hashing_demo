# Hashing Demo

## Comparing built-in Python dictionaries to an array-based dictionary implementation

### Python source file: hashing.py

Usage: `python3 hashing.py`

### Jupyter notebook: hashing_demo.ipynb

Usage: `jupyter notebook .` (from the directory where the .ipynb file is stored), click on hashing_demo.ipynb

## Building a (toy) hash table

Feel free to play around with the code!

### Python source files: toy_hashtable.py and toy_hashtable_collisions.py

Usage: `python3 toy_hashtable.py` `python3 toy_hashtable_collisions.py`

### Jupyter notebook: toy_hashtable.ipynb

Usage: `jupyter notebook .` (from the directory where the .ipynb file is stored), click on toy_hashtable.ipynb

Note: You can also install the Jupyter notebooks extension for VSCode and open the .ipynb files using VSCode.
